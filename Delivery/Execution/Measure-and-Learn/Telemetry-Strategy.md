## Overall approach and strategy

>**_Guidance for editors (delete when not needed)_**
>
>Detail the approach and strategies for telemetry/instrumentations. Different features may need to implement or have different requirements should be documented in different sections.
>

### Business scenarios

>**_Guidance for editors (delete when not needed)_**
>
>Describe how will telemetry allow to understand the application behaviour in the business scenarios.
>

### Application Layers

>**_Guidance for editors (delete when not needed)_**
>
>In the different application layers, describe what will be the strategy used to generate the required telemetry.
>Feel free to change the topics considered in this page. If needed, feel free to create a folder and subpages to better accomodate more information.

### IaaS available telemetry

>
>If the solution leverages IaaS capabilities, what is the telemetry that will be used and how it links back to the business scenarios and application layers telemetry.
>

### PaaS available telemetry
