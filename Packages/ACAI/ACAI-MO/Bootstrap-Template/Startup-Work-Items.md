# Standard Work Items

In an effort to reduce the amount of work that teams need to do when getting started with DevOps, we have created a simple list of playbooks that a team can use in order to ensure they have the essential foundational aspects of DevOps done. Not doing any of this work would mean the team will struggle to do DevOps properly.

# How to get started

The Startup playbooks are included in the backlog of your Azure DevOps Project. To access startup playbook(s) Go to Boards -> Backlogs.
 Based on workstreams which are prominent in customer environment, you can use one or more of following initial playbook(s):
